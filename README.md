# Course Tracker

### By Noah Gottlieb

## Description

### In this independent project I created a course tracker that will help the user decide which programming language best fits them. I made drop down menus for the user to make their selection. In the menu i attributed values to be compared with in my JavaScript. Below that i added two input fields for the user to input their first and last names that will then be added to the front of their end result.

### In the Javascript i took the users selection which were attributed the values 1-5 and parseInt them into numbers from the default string. I then used those numbers in if() statements to determine their result.
